# A basic A-Frame scene

This page contains a basic scene that is created using the a-frame library https://aframe.io/

This whole scene is a single html file. HTML files are files containing webpages.

You could save the file [index.html](index.html) to your computer (e.g. by cloning this repo). Then you can open it in a browser to view it.

## Editing using a sandbox
There are many sandbox environments on the web preconfigured to edit html+javascript code. To open any github repo in [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io) change the url from ```github.com/[...]``` to ```githubbox.com/[...]```. Note that any changes you do will be stored on [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io) and will not be contributed back to this repository. 

## Basic HTML
This page is written in HTML+Javascript. Take a look at 
 a [html crash course](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) if you are unfamiliar, but you can pick up the basics by experimenting and playing around. 

 The best way to play around is to create a sandbox on [codesandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io).

### Comments
