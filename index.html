      <!-- This is the camera -->
      <!--
        Let us not worry about the camera for now.
        The code below specifies a camera that can be controlled with a keyboard
        and by looking around with a mouse
      -->
      <a-entity id="rig" wasd-controls position="0 0 0">
        <a-entity
          id="camera"
          camera="fov:55"
          position="0 1.6 0"

      <!-- # Entities
        A scene consists of entities.
        Entities are custom html tags of type `<a-entity>`.
        Do not forget the closing tag `</a-entity>`.
        
        Entities by themselves do not contain or display anything.
        To make an entity do something you need to assign components to them.
        
        Components look like html attributes: they are specified in the opening <a-entity> tag
          Example (below):
          - `id` is an HTML attribute; it specifies a unique identifier for the element
          - `geometry` is an A-Frame component; it tells us that the entity has a geometry (a shape)
          - `material` is an A-Frame component; it tells us that the entity has a material (color/texture)
          - `position` is an A-Frame component; it tells us that the entity has a place in space (coordinates)
          - `rotation` is an A-Frame component; it tells us that the entity is rotated in space somehow (expressed using Euler angles)
        Components/attributes come usually in name/value pairs

        See the documentation for a list of components
